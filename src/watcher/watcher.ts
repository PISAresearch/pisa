    // there are three separate processes that can run concurrently as part of the watcher
    // each of them updates the data store.
    // 1) NEW APPOINTMENTS:
    //      New appointments are added or updated in the store keyed by appointment.getStateLocator()
    //        i) If an appointment with that locator exists and has a lower nonce, it is updated to be the new appointment
    //        ii) If an appointment with that locator exits and it has a higher or equal nonce, the new appointment is rejected
    //        iii) If it does not exist, it is added
    //      After the appointment has been added to the store it is then and then subscribed to. We subscribe last
    //      because if the event to which the appointment is subscribed is fired then that event will try to remove the
    //      appointment and put the add and remove into a race condition. Therefore we wait until we are certain that the
    //      appointment has been added before it can become possible for it to be removed.
    // 2) OBSERVED EVENTS
    //      When subscribed appointments are observed as events they are first pased to the responder. Then they are
    //      removed from the remote store, and finally from the local store. When appointments are removed they are
    //      keyed by appointment id we are sure to try and remove the exact appointment that the listener was subscribed
    //      against. If the appointment was not in the db, since appointments can be removed in any of these 3 processes:
    //      (new appointments, observed events, GC) then this should not be considered an error
    // 3) GARBAGE COLLECTION (GC)
    //      Periodically appointments will be checked to see if they have expired. To make this process easier we could
    //      order the appointments by expiry date, then pop the top appointment and see if it has expired. If it hasn't
    //      then wait until the next poll. If it has then continue popping appointments until the we reach one that has
    //      not expired. Expired appointment should be removed first from the remote store then the local and unsubsribced,
    //      either singularly or batched, but the order here does not matter. Again deletes should by keyed by
    //      appointment id, and it shouldn't matter if an appointment does not exist to be deleted. (Although this
    //      should be unlikely)
